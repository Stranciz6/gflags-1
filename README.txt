A commandline flags library that allows for distributed flags.

This package contains a library that implements commandline flags
processing.  As such it's a replacement for getopt().  It has increased
flexibility, including built-in support for C++ types like string, and
the ability to define flags in the source file in which they're used.
The devel package contains static and debug libraries and header files
for developing applications that use the gflags package.
